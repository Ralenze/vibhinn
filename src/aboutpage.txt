Hi! I’m a student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. When I’m not busy cramming last-minute for a test, finishing homework minutes before deadline, or doomscrolling on social media, I like to do other things (crazy, I know)! Some of my hobbies include playing video games, reading up on history, playing and studying music, and hiking.

	In Grade 11, I realized that computers can be used for more purposes than just video games (shocking!). I realized that computers can be used to code programs, and I realized I was pretty good at coding. At least that’s what code.org had me believe. My days of fun soon ended as I started practicing programming, and dealt with a heavy workload. I dealt with, and completed nearly all of my Grade 12 courses in Grade 11. With that, I was able to enjoy my senior year with more comfort. 

	Well? 

	Where am I now? 


	I’m at Waterloo. I really want to learn more about machine learning and algorithms. Of course, that’s not all. I would really love to become a better musician. If I had a million dollars, I would hundred percent choose to
