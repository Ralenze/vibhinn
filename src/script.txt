I’m Vibhinn. X



If you are reading this, you probably already knew that. X

I was born in Delhi, India. I’m sure you know that too. X
You probably know other things about me, as well. 

For example, I like to play several instruments. 

I picked up my first instrument, the Euphonium (which is not a baritone), in elementary school. Through that, I realized just how much I loved music. I stuck with the euphonium ( it’s NOT a baritone! ) until Grade 11, where I decided to take on the Tuba. X

You may also know that I love studying math. If you ever want to talk about numbers, count me in! X

Anyway, this website isn’t for me to ramble on about my hobbies. 
If you’d like me to continue, there’ll be an option for you to comeback to this anytime. Enjoy - and happy coding! X
